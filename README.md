# Bookbot Project  

The **Bookbot** project, part of the back-end development course from [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev).  
This project is for practicing beginner Python skills.

The project reads the text from a book file, counts the number of words, and counts the occurrences of each character in the text. It then generates a report displaying these counts.
